## Description
This week I was tasked to create a README generator using node and an npm program called inquirer. The user should be able to initialize the program and then be prompted with questions regarding their project. When the user finishes, a function with markdown code will generate a skeleton of a README and use the information the user typed to customize the markdown to suit their project.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To use the program you must have node.js (LTS version) installed on your computer. Once you've completed that and successfully cloned this repository, open the integrated terminal in the proper location (type ls to view location) and type npm install. This will download all proper moduled from the inquirer app. You're almost ready to go!

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
This program will use your input to generate a professional README. For example, when you are prompted to input your github username, the program will use that information and use it in a ref link. The link will send any viewer to your github profile.

## Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>
This project is not currently open for contribution.

## Test it <a name="tests"></a>

Try the program out yourself!
The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```
node index.js
```
